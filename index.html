            <p>I am just begginer with a lot of dreams.My hobbey is singing and watching flims.I love to code its seems
                so
                much fun for me.
                I have learned HTML and css and also can put my practical code to github.And its very easy to work.But
                nobody pays me a dime for
                that work.That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development Hero.

                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
